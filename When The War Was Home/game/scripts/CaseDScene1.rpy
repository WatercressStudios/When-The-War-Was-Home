    # BG sky with black snow

    "It's freezing today. The forecast said we might get some sunlight about now."

    "Filthy liars."

    "Even the pavement is iced over."

    "Some of my fellow victims on the street had the foresight of bringing an umbrella. Lucky them."

    "I hope everyone's properly cleaning out the black snow from their chassis. Last thing we need is for the clinic to be flooded with black snow poisoning cases."

    # SFX new message on phone

    "It's a text message from Aarul."

    "\"Don't forget to pack your umbrella. They updated the forecast this morning.\""

    "..."

    "Too late, kiddo."

    # BG of building exterior

    "Looks like this apartment has seen better days."

    "I step up to the front door, brush the black snow off my shoulders, and raise my finger towards the doorbell. But before I can touch it, the display panel next to the door lights up."

    # show building emoticon and panel

    # VA: spoken with authority, like a soldier
    bui "Halt. Identify yourself."

    "Something in the tone of their voice put me on alert. A security system?"

    mc "Doctor Imani Ward. The superintendent asked for a house call."

    bui "Please hold."

    # sfx of scanning

    bui "Visual identification verified. Please answer the security question to complete your authentication."

    "Um, security question? I quickly skim through the case file on my tablet again."

    "Nope. Definitely no mention of it."

    "Did Aarul forget to write it down or something?"

    mc "Sorry, there must be some miscommunication-"

    bui "Please state the name of your adopted child."

    "Excuse me? That's private information!"

    "Speaking of which, how would you even know the answer?"

    "Then it hits me. They have security clearance. This apartment... must be one of {i}those{/i}. The ones in the war."

    "I turn my gaze back towards the face on the display panel."

    mc "Aarul."

    bui "Authentication successful."

    # VA: tone of the voice suddenly changes to a friendly butler/servant
    bui "Welcome, doctor! Please come inside and enjoy the warmth. The name's Winston."

    #sfx of a door unlocking and opening

    "That's quite the change in attitude. Well, I'm not complaining. I nod at Winston before stepping inside."

    # BG building corridor

    "A comfortable warm air instantly envelops me."

    "Unlike the exterior, the interior is flawless. I can practically see reflections of myself on the meticulously polished door handles."

    "It's rather impressive."

    # angry crowd ambience

    "A little bit further down the corridor I find a group of dissatisfied residents gathering around a display panel."

    ric "It went on for thirty minutes - {i}thirty minutes!{/i} I couldn't go back to sleep after that. This is unacceptable, Winston."

    "This voice..."

    # show Ric from Case A

    mc "Ric?!"

    ric "Dooooc, you're finally here!"

    "Breaking away from the others, Ric strides over and locks me in another one of his hugs."

    # VA strained from being hugged too tightly
    mc "Okay, okay, watch the rib..."

    ric "Oh, oh god! My bad, doc. I keep forgetting to not do that to flesh-people."

    mc "Looks like your shoulder's doing well. How's the mobility?"

    ric "Absolutely perfect. Watch!"

    "Ric starts moving his arm in all directions. The sounds from the joints and pistons are healthy. I smile in satisfaction."

    mc "Good. So, uh, why are you here?"

    "I glance at the crowd behind him. They're still complaining to Winston about something."

    ric "I live here. Which is absolutely fabulous, except for the tiny occasional hiccups-"

    "Ric raises his voice and turns slightly towards Winston."

    ric "{i}-like blasting the {b}air raid alarm{/b} at oh-three hundred.{/i}"

    "Ouch."

    ric "But, you've called doc, so all's forgiven, Winston."

    bui "Ahem. Doctor Ward, please come this way."

    # fade out all characters

    "Guide arrows start lighting up the corridor, leading me around a corner, and then another."

    # BG control room

    "The sign on the door says “Superintendent’s Room”, but with all the monitors it looks more like a security office."

    "I can see Ric and the residents on one of the monitors, and myself on another monitor."

    "There must be CCTV cameras everywhere."

    "Yup, this building is definitely one of those utilized by the army during the war. Probably as a barracks, given the features."

    mc "I take it you're the superintendent who called my clinic. Are you also the patient?"

    bui "Yes and yes, Doctor Ward."

    "Good thing I brought the right tools. My patient is a whole damn building."

    "Well, he's no different from the others. First, I'll ask him for a list of connected systems-"

    bui "However, I've already determined the treatment for my condition. Please amputate my thermocontrol systems."

    "Okay, this is new."

    mc "Why don't we begin with the problem. Tell me about it."

    bui "It really isn't necessary, Doctor Ward."

    mc "I insist."

    bui "Very well."

    bui "It's come to my attention that THERMOS-A and B have been infected by the KIXET virus."

    bui "In order to prevent the infection from spreading to the adjacent systems, I've determined that the appropriate course of action is amputation."

    "Oh."

    "Fuck."

    "KIXET was a cybervirus used during the war to disable supporting units."

    "If left unchecked, it’ll cause irreversible multiple system failure. Once it reaches the core, the mortality rate becomes 100 percent."

    mc "Do you have it quarantined? I'd like to collect a sample of the virus."

    bui "Yes, Doctor Ward. I should be fine for a couple of weeks. However, it really isn't necessary. My diagnosis is accurate."

    "I unzip my work bag and pull out an empty neural jack."

    mc "I still have to confirm it. Is it okay if I plug this in here, Winston?"

    bui "Of course. I'll make preparations for the amputations while we await the results."

    mc "..." # VA: worried/confused sigh or groan

    # BG building exterior

    "It's been an hour since I've sent off the samples to the cyber oncologist contact who owes me a favor."

    "A virus like KIXET is no joke."

    "Countless lives, particularly war veterans, have been ruined by it."

    "Replacements for the amputated parts rarely take, because the neural scarring from the virus makes it difficult for the brain to adapt."

    "Yet, why does it seem like I'm more affected by this than the patient?"

    "The way he casually asked for the amputation worries me. Does he understand what he's asking?"

    # VA: serious tone
    ric "How's Winston?"

    # show Ric. He looks serious

    mc "Sorry, doctor-patient confidentiality."

    # VA: back to the usual jovial tone. Laughter at the start
    ric "Of course! I was just testing you."

    mc "Right."

    # VA: serious again
    ric "I was one of Winston's first tenants after the war. Boy, he was infuriating back then. Kept trying to pull rank on me."

    ric "He was so serious about everything. Must have thought we were still at war."

    ric "If I wasn't so broke I'd have moved out within a week." #VA: laughs a little at the end

    "Ric leans back and sighs."

    ric "He's come a long way. I think he's starting to move on."

    mc "What do you mean?"

    "Ric glances at Winston's display panel before leaning closer to me to whisper."

    ric "Don't tell him, but about a year after I moved in..."

    # FLASHBACK BG OF CORRIDOR (probably just BW version?)

    ric "I couldn't sleep, and was on my way out for some fresh air."

    ric "I had to be quiet so I didn't wake the other residents up. Maybe that's why Winston didn't notice me."

    mc "There are CCTV cameras everywhere, Ric. How could he not notice you?"

    ric "Probably because he was preoccupied."

    # FLASHBACK BG OF CONTROL ROOM (BW version?)

    ric "As I was passing by his room, I could see a video playing through the cracks of the slightly-open door."

    ric "He was watching a recording of the old days, of soldiers doing stupid shit and laughing at each other, you know?"

    ric "I think he watches it every night when we're asleep."

    # BG present time building exterior

    mc "...I see. Thanks for letting me know." # VA: pause after "I see"

    ric "You'll help him, right?"

    mc "Of course."

    # sfx of a new text message

    "The tablet vibrates in my hands. My oncologist friend just sent me the results. I quickly open it."

    ric "It's about him, isn't it? What does it say?"

    "I close the file and force a neutral tone."

    mc "Doctor-patient confidentiality."

    # BG control room

    bui "Doctor Ward, I take it you've received the results from the lab?"

    mc "Yes. You were right. It's KIXET."

    bui "Excellent! Shall we begin with the amputation?"

    "I nod. There really isn't any other option."

    mc "Before that, the labs have picked up tracks of military signatures in the virus."

    mc "They're saying it probably passed through several military systems. For example, the air raid alarm and the self-defense weapon array."

    # VA: starts to sound nervous
    bui "Is… is that right?"

    mc "Winston, please disclose the schematics of your systems. I need to examine all of them."

    bui "There's no need. I have it quarantined in thermocontrols."

    mc "Winston. You know how serious this is. As your doctor, I'm asking you to disclose your schematics."

    "He doesn't say anything for a while. Then I feel my tablet vibrate from a notification."

    "Winston just emailed me his schematics. Alarms, weapons, radars, and a command center. It's a forward operating base alright."

    "I quickly scan for the relevant military serial numbers for each system and compare them to the lab results."

    "Fuck."

    "They're all there. The virus didn't just pass through one or two systems, it passed through all the military systems."

    "Only the recently-installed civilian systems, the laundromat and janitor drones are spared."

    "Winston must have peeked at the lab results and drew the same conclusion, because he speaks up before I do."

    bui "No. I refuse to amputate my military systems."

    mc "Winston..."

    bui "Will you amputate {i}only{/i} my thermocontrols, and leave everything else alone?"

    mc "You know that isn't enough."

    bui "Then I apologise for wasting your time, Doctor Ward. Please follow the guidelights out."

    # BG to corridor

    "Nothing I say after that makes a difference. Winston has shut me out."

    "But… it's not over."

    # BG to exterior

    "I pull out my phone and start a call."

    # VA: answering the phone
    ric "Doc? What's going on?"

    mc "We need to talk."
