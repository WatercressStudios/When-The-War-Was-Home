    "Twentyone hundred. The night before Eliza   's operation."

    "We've scheduled the appointment a couple days ago… but she still hasn't said what course of action she wants to take."

    "We either remove the memories of the war and repair the rest of the damage - or we remove all the memories after to isolate the problem and keep them contained."

    "Either way, something has to go. I can't imagine it's a pleasant feeling for her."

    son "Hey, Ave? Any idea when Liz's gonna call?"

    son "The sooner we know what we're doing, the easier."

    mc "Can't say I've any idea. I would've expected it when we set the appointment."

    son "I can see why she'd take her time. I don't envy her."

    "Aarul sits on the couch eating a cup of ramen while I go through the scans from Eliza's brain."

    "There's a mountain of traces of how the disease developed over time - it's definitely getting worse faster than it used to."

    "The damage comes in spikes from what I can tell. It's not a slow, consistent issue."

    "The stronger those memories become, the easier and easier it is for them to come to mind."

    "The more they start to break loose..."

    "And the more they start to devour us."

    "Until it's out of control and consumes us whole."

    "...From what I can tell, the issue comes up when emotional regulators and long-term memory cause each other to go haywire."

    "One major trigger to a memory important enough, and it's started rooting itself into places it shouldn't be and overtaking them."

    "She'll probably be okay, but… I wouldn't blame her if this has stressed her out."

    "Chances are her emotions are all over the place right now. That would mean…"

    son "Oi! Earth to Ave!"

    son "When the hell are you eating something!?"

    son "The more you skip meals the harder it'll be to work tomorrow."

    mc "I know, I know. You don't need to remind me."

    "I get up from the couch, and start rummaging around in the fridge for something to eat."

    son "Do I need to help you cook, or can you manage it yourself?"

    mc "I'll be fine, I'll be fine. I can do something smaller."

    son "I don't want you eating smaller, I want you eating healthy."

    "Despite my objections, he joins me in the kitchen and starts pulling out the carton of eggs."

    "He stops at the counter, a look of concern on his face."

    son "Hey, Ave, I've been wondering... What do you think Liz should do?"

    son "She obviously can't just leave things as they are. Otherwise it's going to get worse."

    son "But I don't know what the right thing to do is."

    mc "It isn't our choice to make, Aarul."

    "I pull out an egg and crack it over a bowl, while the boy grabs some cheese and some veggies."

    mc "When it comes to what to do, a patient has the final decision."

    mc "Our place isn't to decide the path their life takes, just to mend the wounds and allow them to live freely."

    son "Well, what'd you do then?"

    mc "...Hell if I know."

    mc "All my experiences shape who I am today. I'm worried I'd fail myself again if I lost either of those."

    son "I think… I'd choose to keep the memories here."

    son "I don't remember as much of my old mom and dad as I used to anymore. What I do remember is important, but…"

    son "If I had to choose, I've learned more from you since being here."

    son "And the things that I'm proud of most come from the years putting myself back together."

    son "It'd be different for someone older, but that's what I believe."

    mc "...I see."

    mc "My time in the war was… it changed me for better or worse, you could say."

    mc "I want to make right and be someone who can make up for what I did in that hell."

    mc "But if I lost that… I might lose the part of me that wants to help so strongly."

    mc "And the people who need me might be abandoned like the rest."

    son "Well, you wouldn't be alone there, right?"

    son "If something like that happened, I'd be around to get you moving again. I don't want you failing yourself either."

    son "It isn't just on you to be the best you can be. I'm a part of that too, and so are our friends."

    son "That's how people should act, at least."

    "Aarul and I grab some knives from the rack and cut up some of the vegetables together."

    "...If I kept my memories of the war, what would that mean for him?"

    "If I weren't failing myself as a doctor, I'd just be failing myself as a parent if I chose that. Right?"

    "..."

    mc "Thanks, Aarul."

    son "Anytime, anytime. Say, could you pass me the--"

    ##RING RING BASTARDS 
    ##PHONE CALL SFX
    "A ringing sound echoes out from the living room."

    son "What are you waiting for? I'll handle the food, hurry over there!"

    "I step over and out of the kitchen, picking up the phone and putting it to my ear."

    mc "Evening, Liz."

    bar "Evening, Imi. I've got a bitch of a headache right now…"

    mc "...Take some rest tonight. If you can."

    bar "Thanks."

    mc "This about tomorrow's appointment?"

    bar "...It is."

    bar "Sorry if this takes a while, my brain's still a little slush."

    mc "Take your time. I'll be here all night."

    son "You are {i}not{/i} staying up again!"

    "I take a seat on the couch, laying down while I wait for Eliza to respond."

    bar "I'm still afraid of losing what I had of them."

    bar "But…"

    "Eliza pauses with silence for a fair while, before taking a deep, deep breath."

    bar "For the longest time it was like… these were the people I cared about. The first real friends I had, I guess."

    bar "I thought if I let myself not care that I was failing myself."

    bar "That I'd just be destroying whatever I had left of them, or that after everything we'd been through I just let myself think they didn't matter anymore."

    bar "But they'd just get mad if I let that control me."

    bar "If I let myself be hurt and sacrifice what's important to me for their sake."

    bar "We all wanted to spend what time we had being happy, and to make sure others could live the lives we wanted."

    bar "...If I sacrificed the life I have now because I couldn't let go, they wouldn't let me live it down."

    bar "So…"

    "Aarul brings the food over to the table, while I wait for her to finish speaking."

    bar "...Even if it's painful, what's best is to let them go."

    bar "Even if I don't want it, I know it's what's best."

    "Her voice is shaky, quivering quietly on the other end of the line."

    "Silence lingers between us as I try to formulate a response."

    mc "...I wish there was another way."

    bar "...Me too."

    mc "I'll see you tomorrow, then?"

    bar "Yeah. See you tomorrow."

    "And with a click, the deed is done."

    son "Did it go well?"

    mc "It went… alright, I suppose."

    "Aarul and I spend the rest of the night eating our food, winding down before the day concludes."

    "And before we know it… the next morning arrives."
