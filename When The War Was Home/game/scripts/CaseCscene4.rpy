    son "Imi! Give me a call as soon as you're done, alright!?"

    mc "I know, I know! See you later!"

    "I step out of the door and head down the stairs, eating a last-minute sandwich as I head out the door."

    "It shouldn't be hard. Everything should go smoothly."

    "I just hope things haven't gotten too much worse."

    ##phone vibrating sound

    "My phone vibrates with a call from Liz, but I just send a text in response."

    "OMW. Be there soon."

    "It isn't long until I'm at the back entrance to the bar again."

    "Liz is sitting in the same spot as before, covered in a blanket with a fancy pillow on the table."

    bar "...It's too early for this, you know."

    mc "You're the one who scheduled it."

    bar "I thought I'd feel less like shit."

    bar "Haven't been sleeping well lately, I guess."

    "With a sigh, I sit down in the chair opposite of her."

    "Her face is weary, and she holds her head in her hands like she's fighting a headache."

    mc "...You alright?"

    bar "I have to be. Enough for this, at least."

    bar "Better to get it over with than to let it linger. You do a good job of getting people worried, you know."

    mc "Time to cut to the chase, then?"

    bar "Wouldn't be my worst idea this morning."

    "Eliza stretches her arms, before resting her head onto her pillow."

    bar "Might as well take a fucking nap during all this. Night, Imi."

    mc "Liz, plug yourself in first, please?"

    bar "Fine, fine…"

    "She takes the jack and plugs it into her neck, before closing her eyes and relaxing herself."

    mc "Alright. Here goes."

    "I dive into Liz's mind once more, setting off to put things to rest."

    "Stepping into the scene, planting my feet on the ground, I see the rotting plague encompassing all in sight."

    mc "Shit…"

    "Deep purple veins spread through the ground and the walls. Creating mushy, pulsing lesions in the city surrounding me."

    "The grey towers of data have lost their shape, now looking like great trees strangled by their own sickly, overgrown roots."

    "Soldiers lay dead on the ground and bullets hang frozen in the air, turning the town into an endless warzone. The camp is empty, with only faceless corpses remaining inside."

    "I open up the console and ready the command to delete corrupted memory-"

    "Only for several errors to block the way through."

    "Too many of the main paths are damaged — whatever is left is being used to carry data to the memory's core. There's too much traffic for the command to process normally."

    mc "Damnit."

    "I look around at the city before me, and run deeper inside."

    "If the veins are carrying this to the source, then all I need to do is follow them."

    " If I can get there myself, I can input the command manually from there."

    "The city is bathed in red, with bullets and bodies thrashed about into a thousand pieces."

    "Gunshots and explosions echoing out into the sky without a hint of silence in between. A constant rain of noise drilling deep through my ears."

    "The memories start getting fuzzy, appearing to show memories Eliza didn't experience herself."

    mc "I just have to stick to the clearest path. I'll find the core so long as I go the right way."

    "The veins grow thicker and thicker as I delve deeper, lines converging as the paths of the city grow narrower."

    "I delve further and further from the front lines as I move along."

    "The streets are devoid of people. Footprints in the dirt follow the veins."

    "I come across a dark, foreboding alleyway."

    "Everything converges on a single home - nestled into the streets, well out of sight."

    "The ground itself seems to tremble here. The sounds of war grow quieter and quieter as I approach, yet the air grows thicker and thicker like it's grasping at my neck."

    "Inside the house, the veins and the footprints converge on a single door."

    "I reach my hand out--"

    "And as I press open the door, everything goes silent."

    "A lone stairway lies at the end of the hall, illuminated by light from above."

    "No veins lay in this land. This place is sacred, untouched by the hunger that ravages the outside."

    "A scene that shall not be defiled, for all is in service of this land."

    "I softly step up the stairs to the second floor."

    "The sounds of the wind quietly drifts through the room, the skylight shining in through the window."

    "In the room are several soldiers."

    "In pieces and left for dead."

    bar "H-haah--aaa-..."

    ##Sprite here should be a standard soldier bot, recolored into a pink scarf.

    "A single combat model lays against the wall, with a pink scarf tied around her neck."

    "Blown apart from the waist down, with a gaping hole deep inside her chest."

    "The only corpse left in any recognizable shape."

    "As all else is splattered against the walls, left lifeless in uncountable pieces.."

    "And so, she stares blankly, eyes filled with peace and yet a deep, painful anguish."

    "Granted a voice to laugh, yet lacking the tears to cry."

    "Left in a still, unwavering silence for what must have seemed like the rest of eternity."

    "I walk forward, carefully stepping around the pieces."

    "As I come to a circuit breaker on the other end of the room, and access the memory's core."

    "And with a few lines, I push the command to wipe these memories from her mind."

    "The scene shimmers with light, as the pieces radiate a faint glow."

    "The soldier against the wall gently closes her eyes."

    "And in the space of a breath, she disperses into a dozen motes of light, floating out of the window and off into the sky."

    "And soon, the other pieces follow her."

    mc "Alright, that's part one, done."

    "I step outside the building, walking down the stairs and returning to the city."

    "The sounds of battle have ended with only the wind permeating through the air."

    "The veins of the walls shrink and fade away, bursting into light as they carry off into the sky."

    "As do the bullets lingering in the air."

    "As do the corpses littering the streets."

    "And the streets themselves, the buildings surrounding them, and all the laughter and pain buried deep into this city."

    "And yet still, the roots at the bottom that bind to this time, torn from their foundations and tossed into the air like brilliant fireworks."

    "Eviscerated, an absolute annihilation in every sense of the word, never to return as the lights illuminate the skies above."

    "If only it were this easy for someone like me."

    "I grab a seat from the aether, pull out a bottle of water, and rest my legs as I open the console and watch the show from below."

    "The job's only just begun. I still have to repair the damage that's been done. Fix what needs fixing, heal what needs healing."

    "Just hours of mind-numbing work, pouring over scans. Looking to the damage and trying to repair it, pulling up reference book after reference book as they magically plop into my lap."

    "Tending to the wounds and looking at what was lost. Pieces of heart and mind lost in the wave of destruction."

    "Eliza has been changed."

    "What once made her who she was has been shattered and broken beyond repair. Whoever lies at the other end, will never be the same again."

    "But from whatever is left amongst the ruins and rubble..."

    "A new light may shine through."

    "Several hours later, I pull myself out of the dive, leaving Eliza's brain and hoping all will be fine."

    "Pulling my eyelids open, the back room of the bar comes into view."

    "My body is weary and stiff, like my bones are made of lead and my muscles made of paper."

    "My mind is exhausted, but the familiar scene is comforting."

    "I pull my arms into the air and stretch, trying to get myself moving in the land of the physical once more."

    son "Imi! You're awake!"

    "Aarul pops into my vision on the other side of the room."

    mc "I thought you were staying home."

    son "Sadly for you, I can't sit still for that long."

    son "...Is Liz gonna be okay?"

    "Eliza lays on her pillow by the table, still sleeping peacefully with the sound of her breath."

    mc "I've done all I can."

    mc "She isn't in danger anymore, at least."

    son "I see."

    mc "I can tell you the details when she's awake. She'd need to hear it too."

    mc "Might be a while longer, though."

    son "Oh! I got some games on my phone I can show you. Maybe it'll help pass the time?"

    mc "If you'd like, Aarul."

    "Aarul and I sit around messing with our phones while we keep an eye on Eliza."

    "Half an hour passes, and nothing changes."

    "Another hour, and she's still asleep."

    bar "Mmh…"

    "But then…"

    bar "Mhaaah…"

    "She sits up and yawns, rubbing her eyes and stretching into the air."

    bar "M-morning..."

    son "Liz! You're awake!"

    mc "Settle down a little, kiddo."

    mc "Liz, do you need some space or is it alright for him to be here?"

    bar "It's fine, I should be alright."

    "She holds her hands gently in her lap, looking around the room with a weary expression."

    mc "How are you feeling?"

    bar "I'm alright, I think. I'm just…"

    "Eliza shakes her head to calm her senses."

    "Realizing what's missing, a stream of tears falls from her eyes."

    bar "...I just feel a little weird, I guess."

    "Aarul tries to speak, but I motion for him to stay quiet."

    mc "Has your headache gone away? Is there anything that feels out of place?"

    bar "It's not what I'd call a headache, at least."

    bar "Just about everything feels out of place, though. I feel a little lightheaded."

    mc "It might be a little rough, but it doesn't sound like things went wrong at least."

    mc "I've done my part. Now we just need the time for you to heal."

    mc "Your brain is going to be rebuilding itself for the next couple of months. Trying to replace the parts of yourself that were tied to the memories."

    mc "Get plenty of rest, and try not to burden yourself too much. Stability is important in this period."

    bar "R-Right. Thank you, Imi."

    son "In that case, it's time to celebrate. Who's up for some drinks?"

    mc "Do you have {i}any{/i} idea how tired--"

    bar "Oh, I'm in!" 

    mc "You too!?"

    mc "Wait a few days before jumping into the alcohol again, please?"

    bar "Relax! We've got plenty of other drinks around, too."

    bar "There's some more private tables tucked into the corner of the bar. It's pretty quiet around there."

    mc "...Alright, alright. If you insist."

    son "Then it's decided, let's go!"

    "Aarul pulls us out to the bar as we grab our drinks."

    son "Cheers!"

    bar "Cheers!"

    mc "Cheers."

    "I raise my glass without flair."

    "And so, we down glasses of water and lemonade, chattering into the night."

    "When the night finally dies down, Aarul asks Eliza about her condition."

    son "...Hey, Liz? Can I ask something?"

    son "What does it feel like after the operation?"

    bar "It's strange, at least."

    bar "...How the hell do I put this?"

    "She swirls her straw around in her glass."

    bar "I was kind of shocked at how it felt at first."

    bar "I could remember being upset and distressed about things before the operation. I remember all the ways those memories made me feel while I've been here with you guys."

    bar "But… it feels like I'm remembering someone else's life."

    bar "I don't know why I felt that way. I remember the pain but not what drove it."

    bar "I'm still myself, but…"

    bar "For a second, I felt like I didn't know what “myself“ was, I guess."

    bar "It'll take some adjusting to, at least."

    mc "It should get better. It seems to heal over the next couple months from what I know."

    mc "Our experiences are a part of us. Losing them is rough."

    mc "But we can always find more of them. Just have to live our lives."

    bar "Well, there's still a part of them with me, at least."

    "Eliza reaches down to her bag, and pulls out a small leather journal."

    bar "I wrote stuff down in here last night."

    son "Oh! That's a good way to handle it!"

    mc "It's a bit better to distance yourself, you know. Sparking the same obsession while you're recovering isn't bound to go well."

    bar "I know. I had a feeling you'd say something like that."

    bar "...If it's gotten that bad, then I should be saying goodbye."

    bar "But at the very least, there's things they've taught me that are worth carrying along. And the kind of life they'd want me to lead."

    bar "...I wanted them to be proud of me. Whoever they were, I believed that with all my heart."

    mc "Just be careful, alright? Fill your head with some other things for the time being."

    bar "I know, I know."

    "Eliza smiles with a chuckle, drinking down the last of her glass."
