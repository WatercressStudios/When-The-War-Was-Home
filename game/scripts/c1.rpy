    bar "Getting the usual, yeah?"

    mc "Yes ma'am. You know how I like my bourbon."

    bar happy "Sure thing bud."

    "She slides a glass over to me, filled with a dark amber liquid. We lock eyes and she gives a slight nod. I return, receiving the message."

    "My plan to come early pays off more than I expected. She's covering my tab, and while I'd love to shoot that favor down, she would never let me."

    "I relax in my chair, enjoying the lively atmosphere. There are few places as comforting as a dimly lit bar filled with metal and an air of security."

    "We all know each other, we all know where we came from. Outsiders may be put off, but that's not for a lack of friendliness - not everyone can weather our distinct flavor of discontented isolation."

    "I quietly nurse my drink while waiting for her shift to end. Some others in the nearby booths smirk at me, and I shake my head, raising my glass to them."

    "She serves one last customer before roughly yet methodically wiping the counter."

    mc "Looks like you're close to finishing the renovations?"

    bar "Sure am. 'Bout time this old girl learned some new tricks. Oh, and the bar's getting a fresh coat of paint too."

    pat "I'll drink to that, you crazy bitch."

    "A few patrons laugh with her, and I raise my glass in respect."

    mc "Killing the old to bring in the new. Sounds like you finally took my advice."

    bar serious "Don't look so smug. It's only natural - I've gotta look after you assholes after all."

    "The barkeep throws down the rag, rolling down her sleeves as she walks around the bar."

    bar "Alright doc, time to get this shit over with."

    mc "It'll only be but a second, don't you worry."

    bar "So, give it to me straight. What's the prognosis?"

    mc "Not sure. Memory issues can be related to any number of things, from PTSD to sleep deprivation. I'll need you to explain the issues you're having in more detail before I can recommend treatment."

    bar sad "My memory's been shaky lately, but that's nothing new. I've been having trouble remembering specific events,  and sometimes the memories sort ofâ€¦ blur into each other."

    bar "An item where it shouldn't be, an event out of order, damage before it actually happened, that sort of shit."

    mc "Damage? Do you have these issues with memories relating to your service?"

    bar neutral "Yeah. I didn't contact you until it started to get to my more recent memories."

    mc "You should have talked to me the second it happened."

    bar angry "I know, I know, you don't have to tell me twice. Don't ask for help until you absolutely have to, you know the deal."

    mc "Unfortunately, I do."

    bar serious "So. What're your plans?"

    mc "I'm going to jack into you."

    bar angry "Liquor me up first, damn."

    "..."

    bar "Do you have to?"

    mc "I do. I need to see the memories firsthand."

    bar sigh "She sighs, fidgeting in her chair, stopping only when it's clear the discomfort won't go away."

    bar sad "I'm sorry for wasting your time then, Doc. We'll have to do that another time, my lunch break is too short for something like that."

    mc "You know it doesn't bother me. I'll just come by another day, it's no problem at all."

    "The bartender looks at me, trying to read me. She stands up, finally satisfied."

    bar happy "Well, I should get back to work early then. I gotta afford this operation somehow. We all know how much you like to price gouge us."

    "She winks, knowing damn well that's not how I operate."

    "I follow her out of the room, dropping some credits on the counter as I leave."

    bar angry "Hey!"

    "Before she can finish protesting, I exit the building and head back home."
