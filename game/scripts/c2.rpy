    "At worst there could be physical damage. But the brain is a mess, no matter who you are."

    "Anything beyond the basics, you start looking deeper, and a week or a month later whatever you thought you knew could turn out completely different."

    "That's as true in my line of work as anyone else's."

    "Those don't just look like buildings.  They're entire piles of data from the outskirts of the brain."

    mc "...If that's true, why the hell would they be here?"

    "With a swipe of my hand, the console displays its data."

    "Several errors show up - areas of the brain that can't be found."

    "It's not that there's nothing there - it's like a city wiped off the map without ever touching it."

    "Like the place never existed."

    "...With a few seconds thought, I swipe away the console."
    "The problem is with the memories.  Whatever's going on here, it's best to see it for myself."

    ##camera  movement from left to right

    "I look around and survey the area.  A war-torn city in the middle of a battlefield, and a military camp in the middle of a clearing."

    ##Maybe the doc recognizes the city from his own time in the war?  If we wanna edit something like that in later we can.

    G1 "Whatchu know about spades, bitch?"

    G4 "I know you’re gonna have enough bags to fix that brokedick machine gun emplacement, that’s what I know."

    "The group hollers and laughs."

    GF3 "Fine, lock it up!"

    G4 "Okay bits ‘n pieces, shuffle that shit and deal. I got these big nuts for you right here."

    #### End of Empire's Card Game bit

    "I keep watch for a bit longer… but no signs of what's going on show up so far."

    "I examine the tent and open up the console."

    "Whatever memories are strongest are bound to show up near the surface."

    "If these ones are stable then it's a good sign… but it doesn't help any more in isolating the issue."

    "What leads do I have? The towers of data off in the distance, and the missing regions the console can't find.  And then…"

    #Gunshot sound SFX, including a flash of white - some sort of clunky sound of a part of a machine falling to the ground

    mc "The hell!?"

    "I shield my head and duck for cover, but no shots come forward."

    "Only the sounds of the card game and the silence of the wind."

    "And on the floor by the table, a robot's arm lies, blasted off from the elbow."

    ##Include some banter from the card game here, continuing as normal.  For scripting, place/zoom the sprite in a way so the wounded areas are out of frame.

    ## for lee: do this later its probably a camera type thing 

    "A large chunk is missing from the robot's head - larger than a man's fist and eclipsing his eye altogether."

    "His cards lay as a mess on the table, yet somehow the game continues as normal."

    mc "...What the fuck?"

    "I move up to the bots to try and investigate."

    "Just outside the entrance to the tent is a warzone."

    "Soldiers stopped in time, bullets hung in the air."

    "Dozens of bodies lifeless on the ground, laid to rest in a grave of blood and circuits."

    "I step outside onto the field, the laughter of the game still ringing in my ears."

    "She said that they were blurring together… but to this extent?"

    "If it were a physical issue, the memory itself should be damaged.  If it were a panic attack, then the traumatic one would be drowning out everything else."

    "...But these are clear as day.  There's none of that damage here at all."

    "And the card game is still intact.  They're blending together, but neither is going away."

    ##Metal thud SFX

    "A metal thud echoes out from the tent.  I begin to turn my head, but on second thought I'd rather not see it."

    "I open up the console again, looking for information."

    "More gunshots echo out in the distance, as I try to block out the sounds."

    "Where can I look from here?"

    "For whatever reason, there's a lot of data on the surface that shouldn't be here.  And other parts of the brain are inaccessible."

    "...How are the other areas of memory doing?"

    "I search up the region, but more errors come up."

    mc "Guess I've gotta see it firsthand, then."

    "If the console can't bring me there, I'll just check it out manually."

    "With a snap of my fingers, a motorcycle sparks into existence."

    "I swing my leg around and hop on, driving off towards further levels of storage."

    "Driving across the broken city streets and through the jungles of memory, towers of grey abundant in the distance."

    "And when I arrive…"

    "The path ahead is unuseable."

    "What could before be recognized as at least resembling human terrain fades away into a giant pit of jumbled corruption."

    "Whatever roads of data once laid here are twisted and torn, cutting off and simply leading back to the center."

    "And at the bottom of the pit…"

    "Masses and masses of data,"

    "Seemingly being devoured by the ground, smashed to pieces with teeth the size of mountains and swallowed up altogether."

    "I speed over to other areas where the errors are visible, and confirm the same is happening there as well."

    mc "...What the hell is going on here?"

    "Memories and emotional regulators are hit strongest, followed by relationship organizers, and vocal-facial recognition."

    "Vital functioning is still in a good state… but visual and auditory processing is beginning to show early signs of the same issue."

    "I run some neural scans of as much of the brain as I can, before jacking out and returning to the bar."

    bar "Eh!?"

    mc "Relax, relax.  I'll call you as soon as I've figured things out."

    "...It shouldn't be a physical issue. If it were brain damage the damage would be a lot more widespread."

    "We just need to identify what's gone wrong and fix it.  But…"

    show bar snarky

    bar "You've got quite the look on your face, doctor."

    mc "Hah, of course I do."

    "With a laugh, I force a smile onto my face."

    mc "I live a busy life.  You'll never find me without something on my mind."

    mc "I don't think it's a physical issue.  Whatever's gone wrong is mental or emotional."

    "Damnit, my head hurts like hell."

    show bar sad 

    bar "People and faces who aren't with us anymore popping in where they weren't."

    mc "How do those memories feel to you?  Are they particularly painful?"

    bar "...I wouldn't care if they were.  They're important, whether they're painful or not."

    bar "The people I knew live on in the time we spent.  Whether I'm happy or sad about them doesn't matter.  They're precious to me, all the same."

    show bar sigh

    bar "Is that enough for you?"

    mc "...It might be, but I don't know for sure."
