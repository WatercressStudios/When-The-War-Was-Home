    mc "And you're sure you will have time, right?"

    bar "I'm sure, I'm sure."

    "The bartender's voice comes ringing through the other side of the phone, as I walk through the streets to the bar."

    bar "Now that we know how long it'll take, lunch breaks will last as long as I need them to. I have my shifts covered however long it takes."

    bar "I know better than to leave you empty handed twice in a row."

    mc "Sounds good to me.  Easier this goes, better for the both of us."

    bar "Cheers to that, I say."

    bar "How long until you arrive?"

    mc "I'm a few blocks away, five minutes at most."

    mc "The sooner I get out from this damned snow the better."

    bar "Shit's darker than my sense of humor."

    mc "You don't know the half of it."

    bar "You'd be surprised."

    bar "Anyway, see you soon.  I'll grab some cookies in case you need a snack."

    mc "Later."

    "We close the line as I shuffle the phone back into my pocket, chugging my water along the last bit of the way."

    "...There's a lot that can go wrong with a person's memories."

    "At worst there could be physical damage. But the brain is a mess, no matter who you are."

    "Anything beyond the basics, you start looking deeper, and a week or a month later whatever you thought you knew could turn out completely different."

    "That's as true in my line of work as anyone else's."

    "...And where war is involved, you aren't likely to ever forget."

    "I pull myself up the stairs to the back entrance, knock on the door for the manager to let me through, and move through the hallways until I reach the right room."

    bar "Welcome, Doc.  Good to see you finally made it."

    "The bartender sits at a chair in the corner, eating down a half-full jar of cookies as she bites off a good chunk of one."

    bar "...This is some good shit."

    bar "Have you ever wondered about how weird it is to eat something?"

    mc "Not as far as I can remember."

    "She offers a noncommittal shrug, and I take a seat at a nearby chair, pulling it up to her so we can begin."

    mc "Ready?"

    bar "Not at all, but it's better to get it over with."

    mc "Are you plugging the jack in, or do I have to do it for you?"

    "The bartender shifts her eyes, and pulls out a cookie with a smile."

    bar "Uh… you want a snack?"

    mc "You know, I'd love to do my job."

    "I smirk at her, betraying my patience. This would be hard for anyone."

    bar "You aren't making this any easier, you know?"

    mc " Ahh don't worry, you won't feel a thing."

    bar "Easy to say when it's not you."

    "The bartender sighs, and eats another cookie."

    bar "...Give me the jack. Guess it's best to get it over with."

    mc "Get comfortable.  We can talk about what's in there when you wake up."

    bar "Sure wish we had a bed in here."

    "The bartender sweeps her hair out of the way, and brings the jack to the back of her neck."

    "And with a click, the jack cleanly connects."

    ##"---LINK ESTABLISHED---"

    mc "Feeling alright?"

    bar "Nothing bad enough to stop here."

    bar "I'll manage somehow, always have."

    mc "See you in a bit, then.  Find a good place to lay down."

    "I lean back and rest up against the wall, as the bartender rests her head on the table."

    "I close my eyes, as the world turns to black."

    ##"---COMMENCING DIVE---"

    "And when I open my eyes, a field of grey is laid out before me."

    "A ruined city, with broken walls and shattered windows, and towers of grey rising into the sky."

    mc "This should be the right place, but…"

    "Those don't just look like buildings.  They're entire piles of data from the outskirts of the brain."

    mc "...If that's true, why the hell would they be here?"

    "With a swipe of my hand, the console displays its data."

    "Several errors show up - areas of the brain that can't be found."

    "It's not that there's nothing there - it's like a city wiped off the map without ever touching it."

    "Like the place never existed."

    "...With a few seconds thought, I swipe away the console."
    "The problem is with the memories.  Whatever's going on here, it's best to see it for myself."

    "I look around and survey the area.  A war-torn city in the middle of a battlefield, and a military camp in the middle of a clearing."

    ##Maybe the doc recognizes the city from his own time in the war?  If we wanna edit something like that in later we can.

    "I walk into one of the tents, towards a small group of infantry playing cards around a table."

    ##I know nothing about the sorts of card games they could play, someone else write this part.  Include some banter between the soldiers - if you can, soldier sprites w/ some distinctions like different scarf color.  3-5 different ones.
    ###Here ya go, courtesy of Empire

    "I walk into one of the tents, towards a small group of infantry playing cards around a table."

    G1 "What you got on a Moe, partner?"

    G2 "3 and a P."

    G1 "I got 5 solid. Stand by for a Big Moe, boys!"

    G3 "Bullshit, stand by for them bags is more like it. We’re gonna feed you your own shit."

    G1 "Whatchu know about spades, bitch?"

    G4 "I know you’re gonna have enough bags to fix that brokedick machine gun emplacement, that’s what I know."

    "The group hollers and laughs."

    GF3 "Fine, lock it up!"

    #The scene pixelates and skips.

    G4 "No {b}fucking{b} way you pulled that shit off. I had the Big Joker {i}and{i} the King!"

    G2 "We warned your stupid ass, you’re the one who went big-nuts anyway."

    G4 "Okay bits ‘n pieces, shuffle that shit and deal. I got these big nuts for you right here."

    #### End of Empire's Card Game bit

    "I keep watch for a bit longer… but no signs of what's going on show up so far."

    "I examine the tent and open up the console."

    "Whatever memories are strongest are bound to show up near the surface."

    "If these ones are stable then it's a good sign… but it doesn't help any more in isolating the issue."

    "What leads do I have? The towers of data off in the distance, and the missing regions the console can't find.  And then…"

    #Gunshot sound SFX, including a flash of white - some sort of clunky sound of a part of a machine falling to the ground

    mc "The hell!?"

    "I shield my head and duck for cover, but no shots come forward."

    "Only the sounds of the card game and the silence of the wind."

    "And on the floor by the table, a robot's arm lies, blasted off from the elbow."

    ##Include some banter from the card game here, continuing as normal.  For scripting, place/zoom the sprite in a way so the wounded areas are out of frame.

    "A large chunk is missing from the robot's head - larger than a man's fist and eclipsing his eye altogether."

    "His cards lay as a mess on the table, yet somehow the game continues as normal."

    mc "...What the fuck?"

    "I move up to the bots to try and investigate."

    "Just outside the entrance to the tent is a warzone."

    "Soldiers stopped in time, bullets hung in the air."

    "Dozens of bodies lifeless on the ground, laid to rest in a grave of blood and circuits."

    "I step outside onto the field, the laughter of the game still ringing in my ears."

    "She said that they were blurring together… but to this extent?"

    "If it were a physical issue, the memory itself should be damaged.  If it were a panic attack, then the traumatic one would be drowning out everything else."

    "...But these are clear as day.  There's none of that damage here at all."

    "And the card game is still intact.  They're blending together, but neither is going away."

    ##Metal thud SFX

    "A metal thud echoes out from the tent.  I begin to turn my head, but on second thought I'd rather not see it."

    "I open up the console again, looking for information."

    "More gunshots echo out in the distance, as I try to block out the sounds."

    "Where can I look from here?"

    "For whatever reason, there's a lot of data on the surface that shouldn't be here.  And other parts of the brain are inaccessible."

    "...How are the other areas of memory doing?"

    "I search up the region, but more errors come up."

    mc "Guess I've gotta see it firsthand, then."

    "If the console can't bring me there, I'll just check it out manually."

    "With a snap of my fingers, a motorcycle sparks into existence."

    "I swing my leg around and hop on, driving off towards further levels of storage."

    "Driving across the broken city streets and through the jungles of memory, towers of grey abundant in the distance."

    "And when I arrive…"

    "The path ahead is unuseable."

    "What could before be recognized as at least resembling human terrain fades away into a giant pit of jumbled corruption."

    "Whatever roads of data once laid here are twisted and torn, cutting off and simply leading back to the center."

    "And at the bottom of the pit…"

    "Masses and masses of data,"

    "Seemingly being devoured by the ground, smashed to pieces with teeth the size of mountains and swallowed up altogether."

    "I speed over to other areas where the errors are visible, and confirm the same is happening there as well."

    mc "...What the hell is going on here?"

    "Memories and emotional regulators are hit strongest, followed by relationship organizers, and vocal-facial recognition."

    "Vital functioning is still in a good state… but visual and auditory processing is beginning to show early signs of the same issue."

    "I run some neural scans of as much of the brain as I can, before jacking out and returning to the bar."

    ##"---EXITING DIVE---"

    "I open my eyes and take a deep breath, returning to the back room of the bar."

    "The clock on my phone tells me I've been out for longer than I expected to be."

    "The bartender opens her eyes, sitting up and stretching her arms to the air with a yawn."

    bar "...What time is it?"

    mc "Eighteen, maybe nineteen hundred?"

    "I pull out a bottle of water as I re-adjust from the dive."

    "It's looking like tonight is gonna be a long night."

    bar "Oh!  Since you're done, does that mean I'm better now?"

    mc "Afraid not."

    mc "I've… got a bit of research to do tonight.  Can't say for sure what's going on off the top of my head."

    bar "Eh!?"

    mc "Relax, relax.  I'll call you as soon as I've figured things out."

    "...It shouldn't be a physical issue. If it were brain damage the damage would be a lot more widespread."

    "We just need to identify what's gone wrong and fix it.  But…"

    bar "You've got quite the look on your face, doctor."

    mc "Hah, of course I do."

    "With a laugh, I force a smile onto my face."

    mc "I live a busy life.  You'll never find me without something on my mind."

    mc "I don't think it's a physical issue.  Whatever's gone wrong is mental or emotional."

    "Damnit, my head hurts like hell."

    "I set down my water bottle and meet her gaze with mine."

    mc "Can I ask for more information about the symptoms?"

    bar "Whad'ya mean?"

    mc "Is there anything  specific that triggers the memory issues?"

    mc "Stress, strong emotions, any sort of trigger."

    bar "Not as far as I can tell.  They stress me out a little but that's usually after they already show up."

    bar "Rain or shine, working at the bar or lazing around in bed."

    mc "Is there anything that seems to show up consistently?"

    bar "You've already been in my brain, you know."

    mc "Seeing it isn't the same as being there.  I want to hear more."

    bar "...I'm not happy about it, so you know."

    bar "It's mostly from back when I was a soldier.  Gunshots showing up where they weren't, seeing people with injuries they didn't have at the time."

    bar "People and faces who aren't with us anymore popping in where they weren't."

    mc "How do those memories feel to you?  Are they particularly painful?"

    bar "...I wouldn't care if they were.  They're important, whether they're painful or not."

    bar "The people I knew live on in the time we spent.  Whether I'm happy or sad about them doesn't matter.  They're precious to me, all the same."

    bar "Is that enough for you?"

    mc "...It might be, but I don't know for sure."

    mc "I'll call you later when I have more to say.  Sounds alright?"

    bar "Alright, alright.  I'll try and get to bed early tonight."

    "She heads out the door, with me following shortly."

    "I bring the scans up in front of my eyes, and pour over them on the walk home."

    "As soon as I get there, I open up the net and search up everything I can find."

    ##Time passes here, some sort of bg transition to convey this

    "I pull out my phone and dial up the bartender."

    bar "Mmph… do you know what time it is?"

    "She takes a yawn as she finishes speaking."

    mc "Are you available?"

    bar "Is it good news, or bad news?"

    bar "You wouldn't be calling if it weren't urgent."

    mc "Sorry if it's a little late."

    bar "It's… never mind.  So, what's up?"

    mc "Your memories are damaging the rest of your brain."

    bar "...I'm sorry, what?"

    mc "I said, your memories are--"

    bar "I know what you said, I'm asking how the hell that works."

    bar "Is that even possible?"

    mc "...People are greatly influenced by their--"

    bar "Get to the point, doc. No need to beat around the bush with me, you know that."

    mc "...Important experiences play a major part, whether they're good or bad."

    mc "Your memories of the war are overtaking parts of your brain.  They're running wild, growing out of control and influencing things they shouldn't be."

    mc "We can take out those memories and the stuff associated with it, and try to repair what's left best we can.  Or we can remove the ones after the war, and isolate the problem memories for repair that way."

    bar "...You've gotta be shitting me."

    mc "Afraid not."

    bar "Couldn't have picked a worse time to share the news, could you?"

    bar "I'm going back to sleep.  Can't deal with this shit right now."

    "She hangs up the phone, and I'm left to the silence once again."

    "I start to open up more research sites, when Aarul comes around the corner with a yawn."

    son "...Imi? The hell are you doing? When did you sleep?"

    mc "Researching.  Just finished a call with the client, so I'll be heading to bed soon."

    son "Ave."

    son "It's six in the fucking morning."

    mc "Oh."

    mc "I see."

    mc "I'll uh, finish reading these last few--"

    son "Get."

    son "The Fuck."

    son "{i}{b}To Sleep!!{/i}{/b}"

    mc "I'm sleeping soon, Aarul."

    son "Now!"

    son "Do I have to get the rope again?  I'll tie you down if I have to."

    mc "Now now, there's no need for-"

    son "Bullshit!  You'd be up all week again if you could!  Get to bed!"

    mc "Alright, alright!  I'm going to bed!"

    "I get up from my desk and walk towards my bedroom."

    son "...Hey, could I hear how Liz is doing tomorrow?  Will she be alright?"

    mc "...I'll make sure she's safe, Aarul."

    mc "Talk to you tomorrow."

    son "Yeah.  Night, Imi."
