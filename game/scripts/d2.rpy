    bui "Halt. Identify yourself." # VA: yup, this is the same line as Scene 1

    mc "Doctor Imani Ward, and this is my son, Aarul."

    bui "Identification failure. Please leave."

    "Oh, you gotta be kidding me."

    mc "Winston, I was {i}just{/i} here. You visually identified me and everything."

    show son happy

    son "I see you've been making friends as usual."

    mc "Hey!"

    bui "Identification failure. Go away."

    "We shouldn't be wasting time like this. If we don't amputate his military systems soon, the virus will spread."

    # SFX of a car stopping and someone stepping out and shutting the door
    "That's when I see a woman walking towards us from across the street."

    "I smile and nod at her. Just on time."

    "The woman crosses her arms and gives him a mischievous smirk."

    fri "Up to no good, are we?"

    # VA: pleasantly surprised tone
    bui "Sergeant? What are you doing here?"

    "She gestures towards Aarul and me."

    show fri snarky 

    fri "They invited me. And please. It's just Charlotte now."

    bui "I haven't seen you in years! Come in, come in!"

    # sfx of door opening
    "And just like that, the door swings open. Guess no authentication is needed for old friends."

    show fri neutral

    fri "That I'll do. You two first."

    "Aarul and I thank her and slip inside before Winston decides to shut the door."

    fri "I see you've redecorated. Gosh, I missed this place. The musky smell of sweat and oil."

    fri "Boisterous soldiers who can't decide if they're adults or teenagers."

    show fri snarky 

    fri "Drab grey walls lined with equipment we can't fit in storage."

    bui "Sergeant, please, you're making me look bad."

    show fri happy 

    fri "Ahh, the command center. We used to play card games here to take our mind off things."

    bui "And to monitor for bogeys in the airspace. I had the best radar systems in the region."

    "Charlotte walks around the room, occasionally touching a panel, a small smile creeping onto her face."

    show fri questioning 

    fri "So what's wrong with you? Why did the doctor track me down?"

    bui "You didn't tell her?"

    "I shake my head no."

    bui "...It's KIXET."

    show fri serious 

    "Charlotte stiffens, her left hand still on one of the panels."

    fri "August 17th attack?"

    bui "Yes."

    fri "You should have told us."

    bui "There were no other bases standing in the region, and I had it quarantined. I thought it could wait."

    fri "Well, the war is over now. Do the treatment, Winston."

    bui "I can't."

    show fri serious 

    fri "Why not?"

    "Winston doesn't reply at first, and Charlotte waits patiently."

    bui "It's all I have left. Without them, I don't know what I am."

    "My mind flashes to what Ric had said before. Winston watches recordings of the soldiers every night."

    fri "You're more than just a soldier. You're Winston Zu. Right now, you're also the superintendent for this apartment."

    show fri happy 

    fri "And from what I can see, you're doing a damn fine job."

    mc "And the only way you can keep doing that job is for you to do this surgery, Winston."

    "Winston is hesitating. I rack my brain, trying to think of something else to convince him."

    ric "If I may interrupt."

    show ric serious with dissolve 

    # show ric, looking serious
    ric "Sorry for eavesdropping, but if there's treatment, you have to take it, Winston."

    bui "I'm sorry Richter, but that's my decision to make."

    ric "Well, then let's make it {b}ours.{/b}"

    show ric serious 

    ric "Doc, how quickly can you get a MIMRU shoulder joint?"

    bui "You can't mean-"

    show ric shout 

    ric "Oh, but I do. Company goes through the rough and tough together!"

    ric "It's not the iron, wires or sirens that makes us, not as people nor as soldiers!"

    bui "You don't have to do this..."

    show ric sad 

    ric "You didn't have to take us in. You didn't have to take the shit we tried to pull on you. But you did."

    ric "The residents here appreciate everything you've done for us. Thank you."

    show ric smile 

    ric "And we would like it if you'll stay with us, not as a base, but as our friend."

    show fri happy 

    fri "Well, there you have it. You have your new mission. Your tenants need you."

    fri "Are you the kind of man who abandons your mission?"

    bui "..." # VA: intake of breath, as if hit by a revelation

    bui "I'm not."

    bui "Doctor Ward, is it too late to ask you to perform my amputations?"

    show son happy

    "Aarul and I smile at that."

    mc "It's not. Aarul will be here to assist, if you're okay with that..."

    show son groan with dissolve 

    son "Whew, that was exhausting. I had no idea how much work is involved in treating a building."

    mc "That's why I brought you. This experience will be good for you."

    show son serious 

    son "...Thanks."

    mc "Something on your mind?"

    show son sad 

    son "The other patient - he was shaking when we were replacing his shoulder joint. I think he was afraid."

    mc "Yeah. Richter always puts on a brave front, but inside he's the same as the rest of us. He originally didn't want the treatment, either."

    show son sigh 
    
    son "I think they probably needed each other to go through with it."

    "I nod and stretch my arms. Time to head home."

    show son sad 

    son "Say, you think they're still talking about the good ol' days in there?"

    mc "Oh yeah. And it'll probably go on till morning."

    show son serious 

    son "Do you miss those days?"

    "Aarul tried to sound casual with that question. It's clear he cares more about it than he's letting on."

    "I smile and decide to keep the answer to myself."
