    "Whew, it's hot today."

    "A tidy white picket fence is almost glowing in the midday sun."

    "Within the yard, an old woman sings a classic song to herself as she tends to her flower garden."

    m "Oh baby there ain’t no mountain high enough"

    m "ain’t no valley low enough"

    "I pause, unwilling to interrupt her tranquil focus."

    "An unexpected smile spreads across my face."

    "The woman notices me, and with a warm, friendly smile, her face brightens."

    m "I like that you're punctual, hun. It's poor manners to keep an old woman waiting. I'm Miranda Bates."

    "I blush a bit, quickly disarmed by her friendly warmth."

    mc "Pleased to make your acquaintance, ma'am. So I hear that you're having some trouble sleeping?"

    m "You know, I'm not one for asking for much help, truth be told. But I heard that there was a doctor in the neighborhood who might be able to help me."  

    mc "Do you live here alone, Miranda?"   

    "Miranda looks down and heaves a sigh."

    m "'Fraid so, yes."

    mc "Aside from your issues sleeping, how is life treating you?" 

    m "My life's been pretty boring for a while now, but at my age that's a blessing. I like my movies, and love my classics. Simple pleasures for a simple gal."    

    m "It would be nice to sleep through the night, for a change, though."

    mc "Let's talk about your sleeping problems, then. Can you describe what's going on? Anything you've observed that might be affecting your quality of sleep?"

    m "Well, I've taken to not sleeping straight through the night most nights. I keep having the same nightmare about a little girl, she's cryin', but I can't help her." 

    m "And I get these fits, and sometimes I knock over some'a my things."

    "This sounds all too familiar, but I keep my concern from showing on my face."

    mc "Can you tell me more about these fits you are experiencing?"

    m "Well, at first when I woke up in the night I just felt… angry. I never really worried much about it in the past. But these days…"

    "Miranda shakes her head and looks pensive." 

    mc "It's gotten to where I just feel angry... all the time. I suppose that's why I finally called you, because I just don't know why."     

    "I think I know where this is going."

    mc "So you said that you keep having the same nightmare about a little girl, and you cannot help her. I may be able to help you with that."

    mc "May I take a look at your memories and see what I can do?"

    m "Oh, I have never had anyone do that to me before."

    mc "Don't worry, it is painless and safe. I promise. You can just sit and relax on your porch while I work. Is that okay?"

    m "Go 'head, doctor. Let me get you a chair, hun."

    "Miranda fetches me a chair to sit in, and I orient it behind her and prepare to work."

    "Miranda gently rocks back in her chair, admiring the view of her vibrant garden and the lush, green lawn."

    "I carefully plug into the back of her neck."

    "Miranda tenses briefly, before relaxing and closing her eyes."

    "Time appears to speed up, and reality begins to slowly distort until it fades away, replaced with something else entirely"
