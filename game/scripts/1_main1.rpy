##NOTE FOR EDITORS
##Scene uses a placeholder name for the doctor - Dr. Avery, or 'Ave' as Aarul's nickname for them.  MC is nonbinary, terms mom/dad don't fit - will look into what Aarul calls them another time.  If the term changes, edit mentions of Ave/Avery accordingly!

    "I step off the train and walk out into the city, a short walk from home, barring how packed this part of the city usually is."

    "A grocery trip later, three bags in tow, the day sinking deeper and deeper into the blood-tinted sunset."

    "Rays of light cut deep into the street, as the eve of the afternoon transitions into twilight, the warmth upon my shoulders a respite from the cold, bitter air."

    "I take out some water from my bags, drinking it down as the city passes by."

    "Watching the laughter and the tears of the young and the old, as the scent of a burning flame thrashes into my face."

    "Ashes and embers mixed with the ever-present chills, like a…"

    mc "A…"

    mc "Achfhoo!"

    "Snot dribbles down my nose."

    "I tighten up my water and wipe my nose off with a napkin, before tossing it into the trash."

    "A few corners later, clambering downhill and cutting through an alleyway, I make my way to the door. Clicking the key into place, I turn the knob and walk inside."

    "The well-heated room bathes me with comfort, and I close the door behind me, setting the groceries down on the counter."

    son "Ave!  Took ya long enough, didn't it?"

    "Aarul sits, playing with his phone on the couch, wearing a shit-eating grin."
    mc "The sun's barely set.  It isn't {i}that{/i}late, you know."

    son "You've been gone since noon!  I'm hungry as hell.  A snack bar for lunch isn't very filling, you know."

    mc "It's your turn to make dinner, isn't it?"

    son "Like hell!"

    mc "The chart says so, Aarul."

    son "You were gone all day yesterday!  I handled it for you then, you said you'd make it tonight!"

    son "...We're low on ingredients anyway, not like I could make much if I tried."

    "Sigh…"

    mc "I've picked up a few snacks and some veggies from the store.  Why don't I teach you a few new tricks for tonight?"

    son "You're still making up for this later."

    mc "...If you say so, kiddo.  Any spices left?"

    ##EDITORS - can you get someone to flesh out this part of MC and Aarul cooking together?  I don't have the expertise to write this part of the scene well. Wolf note: cutting this for sake of time. It works as-is, anyways :D

    son "Some cinnamon and some pepper, I guess…"

    mc "Well, let's see what we're working with."

    "I start pulling the food out of the bag, ruffling around in the fridge until we find cobble something together, with a handful of fruits laid out alongside on the table."

    mc "Been up to anything, kiddo?"

    son "Nothin' much."

    son "You know how it is, you're either stuck waiting for something to happen or life is rushing you down somehow."

    mc "I've been there before."

    mc "But it's okay to take things slowly, right?  You're safe, there's no need to rush."

    son "...I don't wanna be taking things slowly.  I wanna help with your work."

    mc "You're still young, aren't you?  There's plenty for you to do aside from following me around."

    mc "I'm thankful for the help, but it'd be better to have something of your own."

    son "Not interested."

    son "I don't wanna be stuck at home all day when I could be doing something to help people."

    son "Stuff like what you do, Ave."

    mc "...You've still got a life to live, Aarul."

    mc "The past is in the past, but I'm responsible for you now.  Making sure you can be happy and healthy is a part of why I'm here."

    mc "And you've got plenty of life left to live.  A life you find yourself, not following in some old fuck's footsteps just for its own sake."

    son "Doesn't seem to work that way for me.  Not like I could bear some sorta big university deal like you did, if we could even afford it."

    son "...And I'd rather at least do something than just sit around all day."

    son "Sure, I got my friends online, but the days go by and it's just…"

    son "It's not enough.  Without following you there ain't much else left."

    mc "...You sure that's what you want, Aarul?"

    son "Positive.  Better than being stuck at home doing nothing."

    mc "...Can't say I haven't been there before, at least."

    mc "Even if you're sure of yourself, it can still go badly."

    mc "I'd probably be happier if I chose differently in life."

    son "You've told me before.  Fortunately for me, {i}I'm not you.{/i}"
    son "And besides, if it weren't for that, I wouldn't be here now."

    son "As far as I'm concerned, you made the right choice.  I'm at least confident enough to believe in that."

    "Aarul's laughter echoes through the room, and I can't help but chuckle along a little as well."

    mc "It ain't an easy job, you know?  I've seen a lot of shit in my days."

    son "If life is easy, you ain't livin' right."

    mc "You gotta rest sometime. Otherwise, life just wears you down."

    son "Looks like someone needs to take their own advice."

    son "So, about the work?"

    mc "...I'll think about taking you along more often. Just to get you out of the house more."

    mc "But if you're so antsy to get something done, I'll be throwing other work at you.  You need life experience you won't get from just being an assistant."

    son "Nothing too outdoorsy, please.  The black shit could make me vomit from smell alone."

    mc "Don't I know it.  You get used to it, but it isn't pleasant."

    "I get up from the chair and stretch my arms, having finished most of my food."

    mc "...I think I'm gonna read the news and head to bed.  When are you planning on dozing off for the night?"

    son "I'll be up a while.  Got a friend out west who needs to vent when they get home."

    son "Don't wanna leave 'em hanging, but if things are real bad we could go well past midnight.  I'll be glued to my phone whether or not I wanna go to bed."

    mc "Well, keep an eye on your health, alright?"

    son "I will, I will.  If anything, I'm worried about you more than me."

    "Aarul gets up from his chair and picks up his phone, scrolling through as an anxious look comes on his face."

    son "...Crap, that's more than I was expecting."

    mc "Long night?"

    son "Definitely.  Always on the clock when you live online."

    mc "Well, just take care of yourself.  Night, Aarul."


    son "Night Ave. Bug you about work tomorrow!"

    ##Some sort of transition out of the scene, dunno what yet.
