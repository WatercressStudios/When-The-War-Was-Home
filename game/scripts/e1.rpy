    #add footsteps of Imani walking here.
    "Whew, it's hot today."

    "A tidy white picket fence is almost glowing in the midday sun."

    "Within the yard, {w=0.3} an old woman sings a classic song to herself as she tends to her flower garden."
    #footsteps end abruptly
    #Imani is awestruck
    
    m "{cps=3}Oh baby there ain’t no mountain high enough"

    m "ain’t no valley low enough"

    "I pause, {w=0.3} unwilling to interrupt her tranquil focus."

    "An unexpected smile spreads across my face."

    "The woman notices me, {w=0.3} and with a warm, {w=0.3} friendly smile, her face brightens."
    #happy talking
    m "I like that you're punctual, hun. It's poor manners to keep an old woman waiting. I'm Miranda Bates."

    "I blush a bit, {w=0.3} quickly disarmed by her friendly warmth."

    mc "Pleased to make your acquaintance, {w=0.3} ma'am. So I hear that you're having some trouble sleeping?"

    m "You know, {w=0.3} I'm not one for asking for much help, truth be told. But I heard that there was a doctor in the neighborhood who might be able to help me."

    mc "Do you live here alone, {w=0.3} Miranda?"

    "Miranda looks down and heaves a sigh."

    m "'Fraid so, {w=0.3} yes."

    mc "Aside from your issues sleeping, {w=0.3} how is life treating you?"

    m "My life's been pretty boring for a while now, {w=0.3} but at my age that's a blessing. I like my movies, and love my classics. Simple pleasures for a simple gal."

    m "It would be nice to sleep through the night, {w=0.3} for a change, though."

    mc "Let's talk about your sleeping problems, {w=0.3} then. Can you describe what's going on? Anything you've observed that might be affecting your quality of sleep?"

    m "Well, I've taken to not sleeping straight through the night most nights. I keep having the same nightmare about a little girl, she's cryin', but I can't help her."

    m "And I get these fits, and sometimes I knock over some'a my things."

    "This sounds all too familiar, but I keep my concern from showing on my face."

    mc "Can you tell me more about these fits you are experiencing?"

    m "Well, at first when I woke up in the night I just felt… angry. I never really worried much about it in the past. But these days…"

    "Miranda shakes her head and looks pensive."

    mc "It's gotten to where I just feel angry... all the time. I suppose that's why I finally called you, because I just don't know why."

    "I think I know where this is going."

    mc "So you said that you keep having the same nightmare about a little girl, and you cannot help her. I may be able to help you with that."

    mc "May I take a look at your memories and see what I can do?"

    m "Oh, {w=0.3} I have never had anyone do that to me before."

    mc "Don't worry, {w=0.3} it is painless and safe. I promise. You can just sit and relax on your porch while I work. Is that okay?"

    m "Go 'head, {w=0.3} doctor. Let me get you a chair, {w=0.3} hun."

    "Miranda fetches me a chair to sit in, and I orient it behind her and prepare to work."

    "Miranda gently rocks back in her chair, {w=0.3} admiring the view of her vibrant garden and the lush, {w=0.3} green lawn."

    "I carefully plug into the back of her neck."

    "Miranda tenses briefly, {w=0.3} before relaxing and closing her eyes."

    "Time appears to speed up, and reality begins to slowly distort until it fades away, replaced with something else entirely"
