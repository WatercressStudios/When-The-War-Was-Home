    "As I navigate the web of her memories, I'm able to see, touch, smell, and hear everything that she has experienced."

    "I easily find the source of her emotional turmoil."

    "The mechanical whine and thud of heavy mechs, distant gunfire echoing among ruined buildings, the heavy haze of smoke settled among the rubble-strewn landscape."

    "Miranda is on foot, accompanied by her squad, in pursuit of several enemy combatants."

    "The enemy soldiers enter a building, slamming the door behind them."

    "As her squad approaches, a hail of gunfire peppers the door, one round grazing Miranda'sface."

    "The volume of fire coming from the hidden enemy is severe and almost desperate."

    "Her squad stacks on the door, a flashbang is tossed, and once the strobe flashes cease, the team makes a smooth, rapid entry."

    "The enemy soldiers fall  in a brief exchange of staccato gunfire delivered in controlled bursts."

    "The sudden silence is deafening."

    "One of Miranda's squadmates wordlessly signals to stairs leading up to the second story. She nods her approval and proceeds upstairs."

    "There is a hall with three doors, one of which is closed."

    "The team makes its way down the hall, clearing the open rooms smoothly."

    "Miranda moves toward the closed door, and the wood floor creaks beneath her weight."

    "Several short bursts of gunfire tear through the door, punching into the opposite wall."

    "One of her squadmates kicks the door open and slides out of the way, making room for her to engage the hostile force within."

    "Inside the room, a male with a rifle moves to fire again, but Miranda squeezes her trigger and the man falls, his weapon dropping from his hand."

    "From the shadows, another figure, a woman, darts forward toward the fallen man, and Miranda reacts quickly to the new threat."

    "A younger male with wide, fearful eyes steps out from behind a refrigerator and grabs the rifle, hastily hefting it up and pointing it at one of Miranda's squadmates behind and to her left."

    m "Stop! Drop the..."

    "The young man's rifle flashes and Miranda squeezes her own trigger one last time."

    "The younger male falls, blood quickly darkening a grey shirt - not a uniform..."

    "Three seconds pass in silence."

    "Miranda's eyes pick up a small form huddled in the darkest corner of the room."

    "It is a little girl, probably about 9 years of age. She is staring frozen at the three lifeless bodies laying just a few feet from her."

    "The girl calls to her family in a quavering, questioning voice. Nobody answers."

    Girl "Kahlilâ€¦"

    "The girl's words become louder, more urgent, more panicked."

    Girl "Anse na Khalil!"

    "Still, nobody answers."

    "Blood continues to spread out from the girl's parents and brother, black against the pale tiled floor."

    "The deep maroon reaches the striking yellows and greens of the girl's dress, drowning them forever."

    "Miranda's gaze is fixed on the scene before her, the audio picking up every plaintive, tragic cry of the little girl."

    "The squad radio channel crackles to life."

    RTO "All squads be advised, enemy forces have consolidated on the hospital northeast of our sector. All units assemble for assault immediately."

    "The other squads acknowledge the new orders."

    RTO "Corporal Bates, do you copy?"

    m "..."

    RTO "Corporal Bates, please respond."

    m "First squad copies. En route."

    m "Let's move."
