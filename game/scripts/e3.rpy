    "Where am I?!"

    "I’m back in the present. I am myself..."

    "It’s always disorienting to pull out of another person’s memories. Especially the intense ones."

    "Miranda is still sitting in her chair, with a vacant, distant stare."

    m "I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I…"

    "I rest a comforting hand on her shoulder."

    "She looks up at me. I can see my reflection in her eyes."

    "A gentle wind quietly rustles the leaves in the trees."

    "She is back here, in the present, with me."

    m "You asked me if I lived alone."

    mc "Yes, ma’am. I did."

    m "Well, now you know why."

    "Miranda’s eyes are heavy with a terrible burden."

    m "I can’t stop hearing her cry."

    mc "..."

    m "I try to keep busy. I try to entertain myself, but it’s all just a distraction."

    m "Tell me, doc."

    m "Do you think I did wrong?"

    mc "I’m here to help you heal, Miranda. Not to pass judgment."

    m "Will the dreams go away? Will I stop hearing her cries?"

    mc "I don’t think so, not yet anyway. But I do know that you are not alone."

    mc "The guilt that you feel isn’t something that medicine can cure."

    mc "I can prescribe you something to help you sleep, but you will still dream."

    m "I guess that’s better than nothing."

    mc "Talking about your experiences will help, Miranda."

    "Her gaze shifts to fall upon her garden, her eyes downcast."

    m "I killed those people, doc."

    m "And that girl… I changed her life forever."

    "We both look out at the garden, neither of us seeing the tidy rows and bouquets of color."

    m "Doc?"

    mc "Yeah?"

    m "Could you come visit me again?"

    mc "Yes. I can do that."

    m "That would be nice. I don’t really have anyone to talk to."

    "Miranda turns and we share a warm smile."

    mc "Thank you for sharing your experience with me."

    "I prescribe something to help her sleep a little better."

    "I step down from the porch, and in the afternoon sun my eye catches a single white lily, wilted but still standing tall. Alive."

    "I may need help sleeping tonight, myself."

    mc "I think I need to take the rest of the day off."
