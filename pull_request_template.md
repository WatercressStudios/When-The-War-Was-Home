# How to get your branch merged aka pull request

Remember, to name your branch as follows:
`Department/YourName/Feature`

For example,

`scripters/sagi/overall_review`


Please only request a *pull request* when your department is done making assets and all the assets have been accounted for. 

If you are  a **director**, it is your responibilty to keep track of your department's assets before requesting the Programming Department to approve your request.
